# Twisted-Fate
This is my first game. 
Game Idea:
You are in debt of 30000. You have to kill enemies to gain that amount. If you die, you have a choice of choosing a upgraded character in exchange for money.
The UI design was done to the most part, but there is still a part of it remaining.

The game is still incomplete. I was done with most of the stuff but there is still a little functionalities left that have to be done. Also i was unsure on what to upload, so i am uploading the scripts and scenes and prefabs. If anything else was required.

I really enjoyed this game jam, although i regret not being able to complete it due to quizzes and tight schedules. I learnt a lot, but in the same time had to face a lot of issues.
